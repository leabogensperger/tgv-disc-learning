# Learned Discretization Schemes for the Second-Order Total Generalized Variation

This repository contains the basic implementation for learned discretization schemes for the second-order total generalized variation (TGV). A piggyback algorithm is used to solve the bilevel problem to learn enhanced interpolation filters. An example of such learned filters is shown below.
